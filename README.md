# Hi there! 👋🏻
An ambitious bad boy who currently undertakes Bachelor's in Software Engineering from Southampton Solent University. Dreams don't work unless you do! 🏋🏻‍♀️

Currently in Top 20 [GitHub Users By Public Contributions](https://github.com/gayanvoice/top-github-users/blob/main/markdown/public_contributions/latvia.md) in Latvia

## 🤤 Passions
Personal self-development is one of my main goals. How do I approach this?
- 👨🏻‍💻 Constant contributions to numerous projects. I love developing mine onse too!
- ⚠️ Tools for code-linting and CR automation. Quality and consistency.
- 📒 Docs. A lot of docs. Many iterations, a lot of theory.

Finally, free time – RawspberryPi 🍇! Console games - nah... I love 🖤 keeping my brain busy! Btw, do you play chess ♟? Try challenging! 😏

## 🚀 Goals
Struggling with this part. I always have some in mind for my product, less often personally. That's why my number one goals are:
- 👨🏻‍🎓 Significant Industry Contribution - Success isn’t solely defined by the amount you can gain, but also by the amount you can give back. I look forward to elevating my expertise and enabling me to contribute more to the industry
- 👨🏻‍💻 Master the iOS and Swift development
